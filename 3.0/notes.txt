New way to set up will be all target-bonuses -- these are going to be called "sets"
One individual Item can have many sets
└─ Targeting within a set - multiple targets can be joined by either "and" or "or"

Structure looks like this

Item
└─ flags
   └─ MODULE
      |  // TargetBonusSets
      └─ SETS
         └─ [
              // this is a SetTargetBonus
              0: {
                    targets: [
                        // these are each TargetBonus
                        0: {key: '', value: ...},
                        1: {key: '', value: ...},
                        2: {key: '', value: ...},
                        ...
                    ],
                    bonuses: [
                        0: {key: '', value: ...},
                        1: {key: '', value: ...},
                        2: {key: '', value: ...},
                        ...
                    ],
              },
              1: { ... },
              ...
            ]

Needs to cache itself when item is updated.
Also each target/bonus needs to be added to a static lookup based on the cached key

Needs an API to set values - it should use the API itself
All keys should be added to the api
└─ Should use a common method to add keys to the API so it can detect collisions in case I'm dumb and re-use a key

Add `?` of `i` icons to everything with hover hints

Two separate `+` buttons
- first adds a new set (accompanied by a delete button)
- second that adds a new target/bonus within a set (each target/bonus needs its own individual delete button)
  - Should open its own UI that shows all available options to add - also shows the `?` or `i` from above
  - Should automatically disable incompatible target groups / or bonus groups (i.e. a skill bonus can't be used for weapon targets, or damage can't be used with a skill target)
